jdk contains all jre + compilers +debuggers
jre contains jvm + libraries
compiler converts source code to byte code and jvm converts byte code to machine code by using java intrepreter and  executes line by line code
int a,b means declaration
intiTIALIZATN A=0;


>> java source file is converted to byte code by compiler and bite code is executed line by line by jvm and jvm also converts to machine code.
>>
byte code can be executed anmywhere.
>>
python is also similar but its an intrpreted language meands it compiles and executes same time and commpilation part will be hidden from user that means
it directly runs line by line so its called intrpreted language so thats why we cant use function before it has defined in python.

>>
java is both compiled and intrepreted language.

>>
in python we cant use function before it has been defined but in java we can because they all areloaded before time.


>>
ABOUT DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR::

If you have define a empty argument constructor to a Class, then user defined empty argument constructor will replace default constructor which generated by compiler.

The default constructor is the no-argument constructor automatically generated unless you define another constructor with no argument.

IMPORTANT::::
DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR(NO ARGUMENT) WILL BE GENERATED BY COMPILER if and only if there are no other constuctors present in class if any other constructors with 
no arguments present in class..that user defined constructor will replace default constructor..if also only znother parametrized constructor present then 
also default constructor will not be generated and we will get error when we create an object with no arguments

NOTEPAD++ is just an text editor which edits source code and to run we have to use command prompt.
IDE means integrated development environment which have internal editor,compiler,debugger,code runner etc etc like eclipse which is an IDE.Everthing will be in one GUI environemnt
GUI means graphical user interface like we are clicking mouse to go into file which is GUI.


BODMAS


DM same precedence

AS same precedence



>>
python,javascript doesnt have a character data type like java which has character data type stored in ascii values.

immutable means we cant change value inside like inside string we can't change characters so string object is immutable we can create new string but we can't change
in python also string objects are immutable


JAVA:
String format:
%20.4f
above code converts decimal to 4 decimal points and total value occupies a width of 20 charcaters.

PYTHON:
In python array is called as list we wont call it as array in python.
numeroua applications for list in python.
String and charcater same"" or '';
NAMING:
ABCDEF
012345
   -6-5-4-3 -2 -1
   
   
   Math.max or MAth.min returns datatype same as arguments in java means whatever data type u send as argument they will return them in java
  
   
   PYTHON:
   
   In python all data types are objects means everything is object like variables are also objects but in java primitive data types are not objects.
   
   IN Java and python :
   taKE STRING CLASS object
   String a="hh"
   sTRING B="HH"
   The above is true for wrapper classes in java but in python all data types are objects means no data types present.
   a==B returns true in bpoth python and java but in python as all are objects all points to same location for same value == returns true.
   
   
   IN JAVA
   data types means classification or categorization of data items.
   primitive data types means int,char,boolean(classification).
   non primitive data types means stacks,queues,linkedlist,etc:-(categorization).
   here data may be single or group etc:
   
   
   PYTHON OPERATORS:
   Exponentiation operator : **
   Floor division operator: //
   
   logical operators in python:
   and
   or 
   not.
   
   
   In java:
   We can't import packages from another directory means to import some other package we have to be in same directory. and evertying must be public.
   
   means if i have to use p1.p2.Box in documents folder java file p1 package must also be in documents folder.
   cd means change directory.
   
   
   # will be used for comments in python.
   
   data types in python is same as wrapper class objects in java we can add subtract same type or any other compatible types .
   
   
   to understand wrapper class objects in java ,they are same as data types in python because everything in python is an object,so in python everything behaves like wrapper class.
   one difference is we can't concatenate string and integer in python as like java because in java we can concatewnate string and integer.
   To convert anything to string in python just use str(x).
   
   ~ is complement operator in java it will complement all binary digits and produce result result may be positive or negative number because in computer
   everything will be stored in 2s complement form.
   int will be stored in 32bits in 
   
   
   
   f we want to assign a value of larger data type to a smaller data type we perform explicit type casting or narrowing.

This is useful for incompatible data types where automatic conversion cannot be done.
Here, target-type specifies the desired type to convert the specified value to.

To use command line argument in python:
import sys
x=int(sys.argv[1])
print(x)

here argv is list 


input("hdbch") will be used to take input and any input will be automatically converted to string.

In python everything will be in objects and u can check values just by == in python for everything.
In java for wrapper classes except string if valuES ARE SAME without new keyword for anyobject == vhevk for memory location.
for strings if we use sc.nextLine() they both refers to memory location.

string is non primitive data type
We can concatenate string and int or integer in java.
int is data type whereas integer is wrapper class .
wrapper class principle is same as in python.
In python objects == just check value.
In jave == for objects check whether they are pointing to same location or not.
Integer a=10
Integer b=10 in java both points to same location but when we use new key word they points to different location

String s1=sc.nextLine();
String s2=sc.nextLine();
both points to different location in java.




In PYTHON:

The Equality operator (==) compares the values of both the operands and checks for value equality. Whereas the ‘is’ operator checks whether both the operands refer to the same object or not.

IN JAVA.
for primitive data types == checks for value for objects == check for reference except wrapper class objects and strings class equals() method also check for reference.



Important concept:

for integers and other wrapper classes Integer a=sc.nextInt(10);Integer b=sc.nextInt(10) POINTS to same location in both java and python
But for Strings sc.nextLine() or input()--they points to different locations no matter what,.. in both java and python

IN PYTHON:
print("hello",10,"billo")
, in print block automatically inserts space in line.
In Python string,numeric objects are immutable
print() inserts a new line in python means empty.
print(hebfhb,end="") ends with that inside end.


IN JAVA and PYTHON:
All wrapper class objects and String objects are immutable.
PASS IN PYTHON:
for loops cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a for loop with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.
We can't leave empty code inside if or for so if we didnt have any code inside if or for or while just write pass to avoid getting error.



IN JAVA:
enhanced for loop to access it :
for(int x:a)
iterates through the loop



In PYTHON:
For else loop The else keyword in a for loop specifies a block of code to be executed when the loop is finished:


IN PYTHON :
For else in that code inside else will be executed after for loop has beeen executed but if it breaks in middle else block wont be executed.

The else block will NOT be executed if the loop is stopped by a break statement
wwhile else is also same as for else loop.

NUMPY -numerical python is a package used to create any dimensional array)

.To create a numpy array object we can use:
To create an ndarray, we can pass a list, tuple or any array-like object into the array() method, and it will be converted into an ndarray:

IN numpy sizes must be same to create not like java.

In PYTHON:
Integer:32bits
Float:64bits

if use:
import numpy u have to use numpy.jbfj()
everywhere.
from numpy import *
means just use hdfbhdbfh()


datatypes in python same as wrapper classes in java


TO MAKE NUMPY ARRAY,INITIALLY MAKE A LIST AND INSERT IN NUMPY.ARRAY() METHOD LIKE
							numpy.array(list)
							
							python doesnt allow matrix irregular shape.
							means all rows and columns must be same length
							
							
							
							
							IN PYTHON:
							Int-32 bits,
							float-64bits.
							if anyone if float in arthimetic operation it will be automatically converted to float operation
							
							
							
							MATHS SIMPLE FORMULAE:
							
							LCM(a,b)=A*B/GCD(a,b);
							
							
							To learn about numpy matrix:
							https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.matrix.html
							
							
							matrix multiplication can't be done by normal numpy.array so we have to use numpy.matrix to do matrix multiplication
							numpy.matrix('1 2 3;4 5 6')
							
							to create numpy.array([list])
							or numpy.array([1,2,3])
			
			
			BODMAS:
			
			Brackets first
			exponents next
			division or multiplication next
			addition or subtraction next 
			
			if both division and multiplication present proceed from left to right as they have same precedence.
			similar for addition or subtraction
			if more than two exponents proceed proceed from right to left
			
			exponents:right to left
			div or mult:
			left to right
			add or subt:left to right
			
			In PYTHON:
			String and integer can't concetnate.
			
			normal array.array and list, strings can be concatenate by "+"symbol  so just like strings list,tuple can be concatenate by "+" symbol
			
			numpy array can't be concatenate by "+" symbol instead it will do matrix addition.
			numpy arrays only can do matrix addition or subtraction but they cant do matrix multiplication so numpy.matrix only can do matrix multiplication.
			
			
			so normal array, string or list all behaves like string all methods like they concatneate by "+"
			
			but numpy array will do matrix addition or matrix subtraction:
			numpy array can't do matrix multiplicationso numpy matrix can do matrix multiplicationit can be created by 
			numpy.matrix(pass numpy array as argument)
			or numpy .matrix('1 2;3 4')
			
			
			IN JAVA:
			String is a non primitive data type.
			All primitive data types call by value and all objects call by reference in java.
			{
			but twist comes when we pass string like that inside method if we do any change to string it will point to new location as it is immutable
			similar for wrapper classes as they are also immutable in java.
			
			
			}
			
			
			
			In java primitive data types:
			call by value
			objects:call by reference.
			
			
			
			python is similar to java :
			as everythinh is object in java they all pass by object reference.
			but in case of mutable object inside method changes efects but in case of immutable objects inside method they can't change so wont affect.
			
			
			
			Generalization in python:
			
			In java primitive data types : call by value(values are copied)
			in pythonand java objects are passed by reference but twist  comes when in case of 
							1.Immutable objetcs(string,tuple,wrapper classes) they wont change inside mthod as immutable 
							2.mutable(array,list) they may change inside method.
							b=++a--preincrement:a=a+1,b=a
							b=a++--postincrement:b=a,a=a+1
							
							
			In python:
			we can return more than one value thats the twist.
			as we can assign a,b=5,6 in python.
			
			
			String and wrapper class and tuple are immtuable in java
			
			In python variable length arguments will be accepted in tuple.(*data)
			
			keyword variable length argument will be accepted in dictionary(**data)
			with all keys as strings.
			to iterate dictionary we can go through iterate through dict.keys() will iterate through keys.
			
			In PYTHON:
			print("jsdjb")
			will print jsdjb only not apostrophes.
			
			In PYTHON:
			"+" can be used as concatenation operator for strings,arrays,list,tuple.
			
			IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:
			IN PYTHON:
			"+" will be used as concatenation operator for strings,arrays,list,tuples.
			strings,wrapperclasses,tuple are immutable.
			we can't concatenate string and integer in python.
			
			
			Preference will be given to local variables than global variables.
			
			
			To access global variable with same name inside local variable just write globals()['a']=jdnfj.
			
			print("%04d"%a) -- Similar as string formatting in python we have to use this format.
			
			
			To learn string formatting in python:https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/string-formatting-in-python/
			
			we can return multiple values in python
			
			
		IN python to use global variable inside a function we have to mention
		global a 
		a+=1
		here a is assigned outside function
		or we can use
			globals()['a']= globals()["a"]+1
			
			
			IN java:
			after break or return or continue inside if dont write anything because unreachable statments are errors in java.
			
			
			
			if userdefined constructor with no arguments will replace default constructor.
		if any other paramterized constructor present in class and we try to create a object with no arhgyments we will get error because daefault constructor will not be generated.
		
		
		IN JAVA concept about constructors:
		If no other constructors present only at that time default constructor will be generated.
		If any non argument constructor present means default constructor wont be generated and also if any parametrized constructor present and if we
		try to create an object with no arguments error will occur because as no default constructors present.
		
		
		
		PATH:
		A closed walk in which no vertex will be repeated except intial and final vertices.
		
		
		
		IN PYTHON:
		FUNCTIONS ARE OBJECTS,SO WE CAN PASS FUNCTION AS ARGUMENT TO ANY OTHER FUNCTION IN PYTHON JUST LIKE WE CAN PASS OBJECTS.
		to use anonymous function in python:
		x=lambda a,b:a+b
print(x("NIKHILESH ","BHAGAVAN"))
where x is anonymous fuction it calculates a+b and returns it.

"+" is concatenation for strings,arrays,list,tuples.


just like we convert anything to int by int(4.5)
we can convert tuple,set to list by list(tuple)
similar if we want to convert list to tuple by tuple(list)
just mention classname(argument)
means mentioning class name 
to convert array to list we have to use array.tolist() method same for numpy array

TO CONVERT array or numpy array to list just use tolist() method.
to convert from list,tuple,set from one form to another just write classname(argu,ent)

IN GRAPHS:
CYCLE IS A CLOSED WALK WITH NO REPEATED VERTICES EXCEPT INITIAL AND FINAL.

IN PYTHON:
ARRAYS,NUMPY ARRAYS ARE MUTABLE.
IN PYTHON:
string,wrapper classes,tuple are immutable
arrays,numpyarrays are mutable in python.

TO LEARN ABOUT FILTER,MAP,REDUCE IN PYTHON:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-lambda-anonymous-functions-filter-map-reduce/

We can write a function inside a function in python which is called as nested function.


IMPORTANT TOPICS ABOUT PYTHON:
in python all functions are objects so basically we can pass a function 
we can write a function inside function in python called nested function.


Example of passing a function in python and using it:
def hello(b):
    return b*"hello"
def new(fun,x):
    return fun(x)

print(new(hello,5))


so to use passed function as argument inside accepted function just write func() and it will call automatically passed function.



In python local variables and global variabal variables are regarding to methods. we can have same variable name inside method as it is limitied to scope to access global varibale 
globals()['a']

In java Scope of varibles is defined by declaration inside brackets.



if we declare and initialize inside brackets it can be accessed inside brackets only.


__name__ gives name of module basically the module which we are running will have name as main and modules which we are impoting will have name as file name.


P.py:import Q

print(__name__)


Q.py:print(__name__)

output:
Q 
__main__


In python when we are running a certain  module the name of module will be main __name__ = "__main__"
when we are importing a module then imported module name will be file name of that module.


TO CREATE A CLASS AND OBJECT IN PYTHON:
class Nikhilesh:
    x=10
    def check(self):
        print("obj created")

obj1=Nikhilesh()
Nikhilesh.check(obj1)
obj1.check()
print(obj1.x)


IN PYTHON:
Whenever we create an object they points to different location even there values are same.


PYTHON DOESNOT SUPPORT OVERLOADING OF CONSTRUCTORS or FUNCTIONS.


Inside init when we define varibales they are instance varibles. when we define in clas outside init they are class varibales.


IN JAVA STATIC VARIABLES HAVE ONLY SINGLE LOCATION.means if u change static variables using anyobject automatically changes.

IN PYTHON : attributes is nothing but variables of class.


outside init method in class variables are called as static or class variables they all are common to all objects of class.if we have to change them class.classvariable
we cant change by using instance if we try to take change variables for instance a new variable for that instance it will overshadow class variable for that instance.
To learn about it.We should be careful when changing value of class variable. If we try to change class variable using object, a new instance (or non-static) variable for that particular object is created and this variable shadows the class variables.

when no init method present in python:

every class in python is a sub class of object.
Nothing unintuitive happens.

Your class will inherit the __init__ method of its parent.

So if the parent is the object class (new-style class[1] definition), the child class will be initialized without any parameters.

I hope this helps.

IN JAVA:
default constructor will be genrated if and only if there are no constructors present if no argument constructor present default wont generate. if only parameterized constructor present
also default wont generate and if we try to create it may create error.

PYTHON doesn't support method overloading.

Like other languages (for example, method overloading in C++) do, python does not support method overloading by default. But there are different ways to achieve method overloading in Python. 

The problem with method overloading in Python is that we may overload the methods but can only use the latest defined method. 


IN JAVA collections framework there were inbuilt linkedlist
which is implement using doubly linkedlist.


Cpython is python virtual environemnt(consists of compiler and intrepreter) just like java runtime environment.



IN PYTHON:
Cpython is a python virtual environment(consists of compiler,intrepreter) just like java runtime environment.

IDE means integrated development environemnt(compiler,debuggers,runners).

about cache memory:like when we access google site it will be stored for certain time means already loaded
Cache memory, also called cache, supplementary memory system that temporarily stores frequently used instructions and data for quicker processing by the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer. The cache augments, and is an extension of, a computer's main memory.
IOT is related to sensors and how they transfer information
ABOUT I/O devices:Input-Output devices.
I/O devices are the pieces of hardware used by a human (or other system) to communicate with a computer. For instance, a keyboard or computer mouse is an input device for a computer, while monitors and printers are output devices.


Instance methods have first parameter as instance and deals with instance varibles.
Class method can be created by @class method and it will have first parameter as class and deals with class variables.
static method can be created by @staticmethod and it wont have any parameter and doesnt deal with any variable and can be called by classname.method() just like java.


IN JAVA: Non static inner class can access all methods and variables of outerclass whereas static innerclass can only access static variabbles and methods of outer class.


ABOUT INNERCLASS IN PYTHON:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inner-class-in-python/


PYTHON doesn't support method overloading or constructor overloading it will automatically takes latest as method 
Python support overriding(same no of arguments,subclass) :
Method overriding is an ability of any object-oriented programming language that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes.
subclass method will override superclass.

IN python unlike java it childclass constructor wont call superclass constructor implicitly
childclass is called as subclass while parent class is called superclass.



IN JAVA :
static methods can only call static methods where as nonstatic methods can call both static and nonstatic in java
super to call superclass method.
class Person
{
    void message()
    {
        System.out.println("This is person class");
    }
}
  
/* Subclass Student */
class Student extends Person
{
    void message()
    {
        System.out.println("This is student class");
    }
  
    // Note that display() is only in Student class
    void display()
    {
        // will invoke or call current class message() method
        message();// this.message()
  
        // will invoke or call parent class message() method
        super.message();
    }
}
  
/* Driver program to test */
class Test
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        Student s = new Student();
  
        // calling display() of Student
        s.display();
    }
}


single level inheritance:
a-b
multi  level inheritance:
a-b-c
multiple inheritance
a-c,b-c cls extends a,b not supported in java

multiple inheritance is not suppprted in java but supported by python 

unLike java subclass constructor won't implicity call superclass constructor in python.

IN JAVA:
Static method can access static memebers and static methods only whereas non static method can access both static and nonstatic.
public class Main
{   int x;
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello World");
		Main obj=new Main();
		obj.x=10;
		obj.heaven();
	}
	public void heaven(){
	    System.out.println("I am nonstatic");
	    hell();
	}
	public static void hell(){
	    System.out.println("i am static  ");
	}
}//non static calling static method.


public class Main
{   int x;
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello World");
		Main obj=new Main();
		obj.x=10;
		obj.heaven();
	}
	public void heaven(){
	    System.out.println("I am nonstatic");
	    hell();//=this.hell()
	}
	public void hell(){
	    System.out.println("i am static  "+x);
	}
}
non static method can also call nonstatic method like this but it is referenced by object which first calls firstnonstatic method.

PYTHON has different run time environments.
some of them are cpython,pypy3


IN PYTHON:
Constructor just works like method and method overloading is not supported.

MRO(multiple resolution order) in multiple inheritance goes from left to right in multiple inheritance(means if we have two methods same in two class it calls left rather than right in multiple inhertiance).



To learn about super in python.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-super/
super().__init__()
means the object which is responsible for this will have variables assigned.


POLYMORPHISM:in python:
DUCKTYPING,
OPERATOR OVERLOADING,
FUNCTION OVERLOADING,
FUNCTION OVERRIDING

python supports operator overloading but java doesn't support operator overloading.
Java doesn't supports operator overloading because it's just a choice made by its creators who wanted to keep the language more simple. Every operator has a good meaning with its arithmetic operation it performs. Operator overloading allows you to do something extra than what for it is expected for.


PYTHON DOESNT SUPPORT:
method oveloading,
interfaces
Unfortunately, Python doesn't have interfaces, or at least, not quite built into the language. Enter Python's abstract base class, or, cutely, ABC. Functionally, abstract base classes let you define a class with abstract methods, which all subclasses must implement in order to be initialized.

JAVA doesnt support operator overloading.

Since we dont use multithreading implicitly in any programming language it will starts executing from main method(in python main module) line by line:
For the most part, unless Multi-threading is used, code statements will run in the "main" thread and be executed in order, and will not go to the next statement until the previous statement has completed.

If you use multi-threading there is no guarantee of the order of statements that occur in separate threads.

But within the same thread, statements are always executed in order.(as we use one thread only).

Some high-level languages still support the "goto" statement, which allows you to jump around, but that is frowned upon because it creates "spaghetti" code, using loop constructs and calling methods is the preferred approach.


Multithreading in python same as multithreading in java 
we create object of subclass of thread from module threadingand do obj.start which inturn calls obj.run() and thread starts. a new thread like a new core.
genrally evrything executes in single thread i.e main thread so thats why line by line

IN PYTHON array,numpyarray are mutable objects.



module is like package in java 
to import all java inside package we write import p1.*
and we can use as normal thinking they are in same file


in python if we just import module to use inside classes or functions we we have to use modulename.jnj
form module import * we can directly use everything and everyfunction of imported module without writing modulename.func() again.


python:
integer is of 32 bits but what about greater number
In Python 3.0+, the int type has been dropped completely.

That's just an implementation detail, though — as long as you have version 2.5 or better, just perform standard math operations and any number which exceeds the boundaries of 32-bit math will be automatically (and transparently) converted to a bignum.
if a large number happens python3 automatically converts into bignum type

split method in java returns an array whereas in python return list.
To learn about list in python:
https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_split.asp

li.remove(element) removes only one element from starting in python


operator overloading in python:
for objects like int + calls __add__ method == calls __eq__ method  == checks value if value is same(for strings,integers,list)
so to compare s1==s2 we can use overriding equals method.


String comparsion in python:
You can use ( > , < , <= , <= , == , !=  ) to compare two strings. Python compares string lexicographically i.e using ASCII value of the characters.

Suppose you have str1 as "Mary"  and str2 as "Mac". The first two characters from str1  and str2 ( M and M ) are compared. As they are equal, the second two characters are compared. Because they are also equal, the third two characters (r and c ) are compared. And because r has greater ASCII value than c, str1 is greater than str2.

Here are some more examples:

we can use > or < symbol in python to compare strings and it comapres characterter by character lexographically
so list of strings lexographically by li.sort()

inj python:
for integer,string == checks for value, is checks for object reference.

same like java basically ==,is checks for reference only but for integer,string == is overriden from object methid and when we do == it calls __eq method and it checks whether they have same valeu or not
for strings> checks lexogrphica order.
similarly in java for objects ==,.equals checks for reference due to object class method but equals was overriden in string class and Integer classes to check for values 

python doesn't support switch case statement
python doesn't support switch case statement
python doesn't support switch case statement


in java when we take input using scanner class it will take only next token means differ by space 
in python it won't differ by space it differ by line like if we use input() in python it will take whole line as string input in python


eg:
1 2
in java int a=sc.nextInt()
int b-sc.nextInt()
worrks

in python:
if we do input() it will take "1 2" as input to seperate we have to use split(" ")


IN java we can't scan string after int 
int a=sc.nextInt()
sc.nextLine()
String b=sc.nextLine();
this we have to use||

but in python there are no such worries as everything will be scanned in strings only.

IN JAVA, we can't scan string after int because we will get some kind of error.
IN python there will be no such worries as everything in python will be scanned in strings only and input() function in python take whole single line as input as string.


CPYTHON IS A python virtual environment which uses AOT(Ahead of time compiler) 

pypy3 is another kind of virtual environment which uses JIT(JUST IN TIME COMPILER)
so running python code in pypy3 is faster than in cpython


use command pip3 install <packagename> in command prompt to install package in computer
numpy array is kind of matrixx we can do matrix addition subtraction but for multiplication wehagve to use
numpy.matrix('1 2;3 4')

what is shell:
A shell is a computer program that presents a command line interface which allows you to control your computer using commands entered with a keyboard instead of controlling graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with a mouse/keyboard combination.
in windows command prompt and powershell are types of shells.

in ubuntu(linux OS).it consists of terminal which works on different shells(like backward bash(default)) bash is also kind of shell(bourne again shell) its command line interface
gitbash means git command prompt 

//about command line interface ...intracting with commands
IN windows: there will be no terminals cmd and powershells are automatic shells+terminals(because they shows input/output,they act as shells)
linux is unix like os so we can execute unix commands on linux.
in unix,linuxos system(ubuntu) there will be two : terminal emulator,shells.
terminal emulator means which shows input/output whereas shell like bash(bourne again shell) is backgrouhnd of terminal which actually intreprets command and do something.

default shell in linux is bash.

git bash is a kind of bash shell which executes normal unix commands + git commands.



To learn about collections frame work in java:
https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.javatpoint.com%2Fcollections-in-java&psig=AOvVaw1e6E3BxuL_E7rEsRGDqf2K&ust=1628568401921000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAsQjRxqFwoTCLCZxqCIo_ICFQAAAAAdAAAAABAO
see this image.
basically Collection is an interface which is extended by list interface
and linkedlist,arraylist implements list interface similarly we can use stack.

Map is not belonging to Collections Framework it is different and works in key value pairss.
We can't create object Queue of Collection because Queue is an interface in Collections framework.So we can't create object of queues
in collections framwork like linkedlist,arraylist,stack


Responsive webpages means mode of webpages changes with devices like it changes according to mode of device we can use bootstrap and media query to make 
responsive webpages


Like mediaquery and bootstrap can be used to make responsive webpage .responsive webpage means it develops or changes its mode of webpage according to device
it can be done by bootstrap col element class and mediaquery also.

char is 16bits in java-2bytes.
char is 16bits in java-2bytes.
char is 16bits in java-2bytes.


IN PYTHON:
int -32bits.
float-64bits.

IN JAVA:
char-16bits.(2bytes)
duble-64
byte-short-int-long-float-double



IN JAVA:
char and int are compatible int is of 32bits where as char is of 16bits so int a='a' occurs through implicit but char a=96 also gives current because although we can do explciit but char is stored in ascii values like binary format
so it behaves somewhat like integers. like 'a'+'b' gives integer result like that
String and int can concatenate in java.

System.out.println('a'+'b'+"jsbcbc") it happens through 97+98+"jdj" means they somewhat behave like integers as they are stored in system as ascii codes.

because in java characters are stored in ascii codes.

absolute answer means computed-correct answer


absolute error means = modulus(exact-got answer)
relative error means modulus(exact-got)/exact just to avoid relative erros suppose we print decimal upto 6 decimal places then absolute error or relative error less than 10^-6 print decimal places greater than 7 like that or more greater than 7


pypy3.7 is compatible with cpython 3.7 that means it is compatible with cpython3.0(naveen sir explanation)
as we only add some more classes from 3.0 to 3.7 because i m using 3.9 and 3.0 code fine.

set in python ia unordered means it changes everytime we use sequence change.


TO CREATE A EMPTY LIST IN PYTHON:
a=[] or a=list() creates an empty list object.


To find max or min element in java just use Arrays.sort(a) and find max or min element
In python : to find max or min element in list max(list)
In java: To find max or min element from an array without hesitating use Arrays.sort(a)
and a[n-1] is max element and a[0] is min element.


sorted(iterable object) returns list in sorted manner(if it is a string is is sorted in lexographically order or if it is numbers it is sorted accordingly).

To learn about sorted in python:
The sorted() function returns a sorted list of the specified iterable object.

You can specify ascending or descending order. Strings are sorted alphabetically, and numbers are sorted numerically.


generally strings doesn't have .sort() method so sorted(str) is useful in that case as it returns a sorted list in lexographicall order 


sorted(iterable object) in python returns a sorted list it also sorts strings based on lexographical order.



IN python we can compare lists also just like integers which compares each value of list.
l=[1,2,3]
li=[1,4,6]
print(l>=li) gives False.


it compares each and every value of list beacuese when we do that it calls .greq meethod in list which compares each and every values.
also we can compare strings based on lexographical order.
list of strings.sort() sorts list in lexographical order.

NESTEDLIST SORTING IN PYTHON:
nested lists of list will be sorted based on first element of nested list
Sorting a nested list using Python sort() If we call the Python sort() list function on a nested list, only the first elements from the list elements are used for the sorting. Let's understand this with a simple example. It's clear that the sorting is performed based on the first element in the nested list.

if we call li.sort() and li having nested lists they will be sorted based on 

Sorting a nested list using Python sort() If we call the Python sort() list function on a nested list, only the first elements from the list elements are used for the sorting. Let's understand this with a simple example. It's clear that the sorting is performed based on the first element in the nested list.

zip function in python takes two inputs and links respective items of two iterators and if we use dict(zip(a,b)) it will provide a dictionary with a values key b values value

nested lists of list will be sorted based on first elemebt of nested lists
sorted(iterable object) returns list useful for string also

li.sort() sorts based on lexographicalorder also


To know which is better C++ or python for competitive programming:
https://medium.com/@kunemohith/c-or-python3-for-competitive-programming-8ccbb7285498


for smaller inputs python works fine but for larger inputs and we are doing some calculations regarding that python takes time more than C++ so thats why we have to use C++ for competitive programming

EG:
2+3 in python is easier than java or C++


but 100000000000000+1000000000000 in C++ is faster than java than python although pypy is faster than cpython but it is lesser than java
So if algorithm is same and we have to process very big numbers we have to use C++>JAVA>pypy>Python.

because java and python takes more time to process very big numbers as C++ on compilation directly converts to machine code.
/* ABOUT CP
IN COMPETITVE PROGRAMMING:
So for same algorithm and larger inputs our preference must be C++>JAVA>PYPY>PYTHON
if asked relative or absolute error<106-6
print result >6decimal places.



compiled languagers means compiler converts source code to machine code and it is run by CPU
intreprted languages source code is run by intrpreter line by line without compiling means direct running using intrperter
java compiles to byte code bytecode is interpreted(or run) by intrpreter

for larger inputs(which is common in competitive programming) and same algorithms:
		C++(compiled)>JAVA>PYPY>PYTHON
		
		java and python and pypy(compiled and intreprted languages)(pypy uses JIT compiler) whereas cpython uses AOT compiler.
		
		SO if we have one algorithm and we have very larger inputs:
		use C++>JAVA>PYPY>PYTHON

Normal web server:
like django,nodejs servers are application servers.
A dynamic web server consists of a static web server plus extra software, most commonly an application server and a database. We call it "dynamic" because the application server updates the hosted files before sending content to your browser via the HTTP server.


Just as the IP address identifies the computer, The network port identifies the application or service running on the computer. The use of ports allow computers/devices to run multiple services/applications. The diagram below shows a computer to computer connection and identifies the IP addresses and ports.



django server is an application server(http server+software) and it listens to certain port one port corresponds to one application here project.
basically client makes an http request and server returns http response.

package in python is a combination of modules package in python is a combination of modules
package in python is a combination of modules just like package in java is a combination of different java files.


suppose sounds.sub.echo means sounds is top level package nexxt sub is package where echo is a module with py extension.
just like java packages may contain another packages

ALL HTTP REQUESTS are send using request methods by default get method(it is used to get data from server) post is used to post data to server
All requests are sent using an "HTTP method"


HTTP requests are sent using http methods.


Ctrl + C is used to send a SIGINT signal, which cancels or terminates the currently-running program

ctrl+c in command prompt to quit the program.
ctrl+c in command prompt to quit the program.
ctrl+c in command prompt to quit the program.


IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:
CTRL+C in command prompt to quit the program.
CTRL+C in command prompt to quit the program
CTRL+C in command prompt to quit the program.
CTRL+c in command prompt to quit running program
Ctrl +c in command prompt to quit running program
Ctrl+c in command prompt to quit the running program.

IN COMMAND PROMPT:
ctrl+c automatically terminates current running program.
ctrl+c automatically terminates current running program.
ctrl+c automatically terminates current running program.



IN JAVA about packages:
You don't need to import classes in the same package as the current class, they're automatically imported.
import statement must be used when there are different packages if packages are in same file we don't need to use import
also check the directory before.

Generally in python same directory modules can be got by import modulename.(in django to use views in urls.py we have to use from . import views)
In java same directory java files will automatically imported without an import statement.


DJANGO DOUBT:
form . import views
it is related to packages like directories can be created by __init__ file in it 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44262586/django-tutorial-from-import-views


"." indicates from same directory where file exist import views module



atom,notepad++,visual studio code also is source code editors only
means it doesn't provide everything like debuggers,compiler

/*IMPORTANT
Visualstudio,eclipse,pycharm is an IDE means it contains everything required for programming
VSCODE,atom,notepad++ are source code/text editors.

UI means userinterface like buttons,etc:
UX means userexperience developer means how users feel when browsing like that UX developer basically have an idea about both frontend and backend
but mostly both related to frontend as user experience also related to frontend.

We can use user fields anywhere in template using {{user.field}}


This is what happens in django:

when http rwuest method is POST request is an object which has object variable POST request.POST contains all posted data request.FILES contains all posted files dats in dictionary format
A dictionary-like object containing all given HTTP POST parameters, providing that the request contains form data will reach server

dictionary in python has get method also dictionary in python same as hashmap


internal css and inline css both workon html templates

 checks whether certain queryset exists or not
 exists() only works for querysets, get() returns an instance not a queryset. – RemcoGerlich Dec 1 '16 at 12:03 
 filter,all gives query set and exists() check if query set is null or not
 
 
 
 BODMAS:

 exit controllled loop means do while loop means condition will be checked after loop of body executes:
 An exit controlled loop is that category of loops in which the test condition is checked after the execution of the body of the loop.Thus,an exit control loop executes at least once even when the test condition fails.
 
 Do while loop is exit controlled loop in java
 
 
 entry controlled loop means loop of body executes after checking condition.
 like while loop 
 
 
 
 IMPORTANTTO REMEBER IN JAVA:
 EXIT Controlled loop in java :do while loop is exit controlled loop means loop of body executes before check condition:
 eg:do while loop
 
 ENTRY Controlled loop in java : means loop of body executes after checking condition.
 
 eg:while,for ,etc:-
 
 relational operator:>,<
 logic means && or ||
 conditionals statements means like if ,else statement
 
 
 IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:
 
 Exit controlled loop means do while loop like body executes before checking condition
 like do while loop in java
 
 Entry controlled loop means body of loop executes after checking condition
 wg:for,while loop in java
 
 relational operators in java:>,<
 
 logical operators:&& ||
 conditional statements: if else statements like probabiliy concept

 ABOUT SLICE IN JQUERY:
 slice() method constructs a new jQuery object containing a subset of the elements specified by the start and, optionally, end argument. The
 
 show() works on elements hidden with jQuery methods and display:none in CSS (but not visibility:hidden).
 show doesn't workon visibility hidden elementsvisibilit:hidden means occupies space
 display none means doesn't occupies space but can be interacted throughDOM model
 
 div is block element its height depends on elements inside it but its width won't depend on inside elements
 
 redirect in django is a kind of http response which redirects it to another url
 
 IN DJANGO static root is place from where all static files will be served 
 like we d=write assests it will collect all statuc material static url is used url to refer to static files in static root similarly for media
 media root is where all files will be stored media url is used to refer to media files in media root
 
 
 
 IMPORTANT TO REMEBER:
 about collections framework:
 1.Map interface doesn't belong to Collecctions frameowrk
 2.Collection interface
 3.LinkedList,ArrayList,Vector are classed which implements List interface
 4.Vector is also same as Arraylist like same methods add,remove,get,size but its size also changes instantly arraylist increases its previous size by 50%
 whereas vector increases its previous size by 100%
 so we can say that vector wastes so much space.
 
 therefore we can say that arraylist increases its size by 50% whereas vector increase its size by 100% from previous and they have same features
 linkedlist is implemented through doubly linkedlist inside i cllecions in java.
 
 
 IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER IN DJANGO:
 1.postgres(previous name)or postgresql(present name as it supports sql queries) is rdbms.
 2.models is a Module we create a certain Model by extending models.Model class
 2.the fields of model are columns are also objects models.CharField means its an object of CharField class in model
 3.attribute of objects means instance variables of objects sort of properties of object
 4.pro.mainimg.url mainimg has no attribute means url is kind of property of mainimg object which belongs to pro Main model object.
 
 
 is_authenticated is attribute for user object
 i django templates we can use {{user}} TEMPLATE ANywhere because template context processors contains auth so we can use request 
 
 django templates can use logged in user variables anywhere because of template context processors
 'context_processors': [
                'django.template.context_processors.debug',
                'django.template.context_processors.request',
                'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
                'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',
            ],
			
			in this due to auth context processor we can use {{user}} anywhere by {{user.username}}
			is_authenticated is attribute of django user object once user is logged in request.user will give present user object and
			user.is_authenticated is an attribute which checks whether user is logged in or not
			if user.is_authenticated is an attribute not a method for user object 
			
			
			
			cookies are kind of informatio whcih stores about our previous sessions in ceratin website
			
			To learn about more cookies:

			IN DJANGO:
			by default session expire at browser close :false which means session(the time we work on website) will be set to default and will not expire its like we are still logged in even brwser closed
			when we keep it as true the session will be expired at instant of closing browser(not tab) it browser length session that means session will be alive as long as browser is alive when we keep it as true
			
			
			ABOUT LOGIN IN DJANGO SESSION EXPIRE AT BROWSER CLOSE
			You can control whether the session framework uses browser-length sessions vs. persistent sessions with the SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE setting. By default, SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE is set to False, which means session cookies will be stored in users' browsers for as long as SESSION_COOKIE_AGE. Use this if you don't want people to have to log in every time they open a browser.

If SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE is set to True, Django will use browser-length cookies-cookies that expire as soon as the user closes their browser.
COOKIE MEANS they store information like username,password

java compiler does autoboxing or unboxing whenerveer required
autoboxing means primtive to wrapper object
unboxing means wrapper to primitive
li.add heer occurs autoboxing means int type will autonmatically converts to Integer object
Autoboxing: Converting a primitive value into an object of the corresponding wrapper class is called autoboxing. For example, converting int to Integer class. The Java compiler applies autoboxing when a primitive value is:

Unboxing: Converting an object of a wrapper type to its corresponding primitive value is called unboxing. For example conversion of Integer to int. The Java compiler applies unboxing when an object of a wrapper class is:

numpy.matrix('1 2 3;)

 A static method can only access static variables; it cannot access instance variables
 
 the above statement means it can only access static variables which are declared outside that doesn;t means we can't create or initialize inside static method
 we can decalre and initializeinside static method and we can also create obj and initializeits variables inside static method.
 
 query meaning in english:
 a question, especially one expressing doubt or requesting information.

 dynamic webserver contains a http server +software which is application server and database
 ui user interface
 ux means user exprerinece both related to frontend
 
 
 ABOUT SERVER AND DATABASE:
 As far as web applications are considered, a server is a machine where the application code resides and database is a machine which acts as a data repository for the application.

Actually database also resides on a server and we call it as database server.

The different types of servers that I know are as follows:
Database Server --- where the data of the application is stored.

database also resides on server which is called database server
postgresql mysql all these are database servers



according to web application:
a server is where we write code and datbase is where we store
but actually databse also resides on server which is caalled database server.



IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:
Website terminology:
server means where we write backend code and database means where we store information;
but actually database also resides on server which is called as database server..




database also resides on server which is called database server.


A dynamic web server consists of a static web server plus extra software, most commonly an application server and a database. We call it "dynamic" because the application server updates the hosted files before sending content to your browser via the HTTP server.

In django:
By using HttpResponse you can send data only, if you want to html file then you have to use render or render_to_response by following ways.


if we use HttpResponse we can send data only but if we use render we can send html files or whatever required

In DJANGO:
save() is used to save it to the database:
To create an object, instantiate it using keyword arguments to the model class, then call save() to save it to the database.
save is used to sava information to database
save is used to save information to database
save is used to save information to database in django.


IN DJANGO: user.save() is important to save it to the database after updating any fields or not



IN DJANGO:
properties:
user.save() about object model information in database
You can also change a password programmatically, using set_password()
for User model objects in django to change password use set_password although it won't save information in database
we have to use user.save() to save information in database after changing password.
